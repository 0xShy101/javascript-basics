// javascirpt is a dynamic, unlike static languages javascript will change the type depending on what it holds EXAMPLE

let name = 'Shy'; // typeof shows String
let age = 19; // typeof shows Number
let isApproved = true; // typeof shows Boolean
let firstName; // typeof shows Undefind
let lastname = null; // typeof shows object

// all data types here start with let but they end up as completely different data types
// unlike other static languages in javascript giving data type is unncessery
